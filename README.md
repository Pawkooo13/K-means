Attempt to improve centroid initialization using weighted mean and arithmetic mean.

The program includes implementations of the classical algorithm and an improved version, 
two data generators (random points on a plane or random positions of k sets of a given size together with noise of n points) 
and a function that checks the performance of both algorithms. The user can also change the parameters of the algorithm and 
the generated data on an ongoing basis by using the Python library - ipywidgets.

Libraries:
- Ipywidgets
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Math
- Random

The attached files contain an in-depth description of the problem with a mathematical view of the thesis and the results based on numerical analysis. 
The file contains the answer to the thesis: "Improvement of centroid initialization in k-means algorithm using weighted mean and arithmetic mean".
